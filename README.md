# Target-Code-Generation
<p>
The Target Code Generation project focuses on converting source code from a high-level language (or a custom-defined language) into optimized and equivalent C++ code. The tool utilizes lexical analysis to tokenize input code, syntax analysis to build an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), and code generation to translate the AST into C++ constructs. This process ensures the semantic accuracy of the input while optimizing the generated C++ code for performance.</p>
