# ⚙️ Target-Code-Generation
This project is a target code generation tool designed to convert high-level programming language constructs (or custom DSLs) into optimized, readable, and semantically equivalent C++ code. It uses a classic compiler design approach—lexical analysis, syntax analysis, and code generation—to ensure accurate and efficient transpilation. The system provides error handling, validation, and AST-based translation, helping developers retain high-level abstractions while leveraging C++’s performance.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Converts high-level or custom-defined source code into optimized C++ code  
- 🔍 Performs lexical analysis to tokenize source code  
- 🌳 Builds an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) for logical structure  
- 🛠️ Generates equivalent and compilable C++ code from AST  
- ⚠️ Handles syntax errors and invalid inputs with clear feedback  
- 🧪 Includes comprehensive testing for validation and correctness  
- 🧱 Supports core constructs like variables, loops, conditionals, and functions  
- 🧩 Modular design allows for future language expansion  

## 💻 Technologies Used

- **C++** – Target language for optimized code output  
- **Python / JavaScript / Java** – Example source/input languages  
- **Lexical Analysis** – Tokenization using regular expressions  
- **Syntax Analysis** – AST creation using parsing techniques  
- **Code Generation** – Rule-based mapping from AST to C++  
- **Error Handling Modules** – For validation and debug feedback  
- **Testing Frameworks** – For unit testing and validation of generated code
